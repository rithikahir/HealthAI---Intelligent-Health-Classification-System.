        <p>
            Tumours that start in the brain are called primary brain tumours. Tumours can start in any part of the
            brain or related structures. Cancers that have spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body are
            called secondary brain tumours or brain metastases. Brain and spinal cord tumours can affect children and adults.

            What is Brain Tumours ?

        <p>
            A cancerous or non-cancerous mass or growth of abnormal cells in the brain.
            Tumours can start in the brain, or cancer elsewhere in the body can spread to the brain.

            The Brain And Spinal Cord
        </h2>
        <p>
            The part of the skull where the brain sits is called the cranium. The base, or lower part, 
            of the brain is connected to the spinal cord. Together, the brain and spinal cord are known as the central nervous system (CNS). 
            Many nerves send electrical signals to and from the brain and spinal cord.

            Grades of brain and spinal cord tumours

        <p>
            Brain and spinal cord tumors are typically divided into 4 grades (using Roman numerals I to IV), 
            based largely on how the tumor cells look under a microscope: Lower grade (grade I or II) 
            tumors tend to grow more slowly and are less likely to grow into (invade or infiltrate) nearby tissues

            What causes Brain Tumor
            Tumors can start in the brain, or cancer elsewhere in the body can spread to the brain.
            Primary brain tumors begin when normal cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. 
            A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do.
